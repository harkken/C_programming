this should be in the SENG 265 folder but this is the first assignment for that course.
i completed it after the course was over to gain an understanding of coding in C.

the logic is 99% correct currently as per the assignment requirements, the only problem is that it doesnt print new
lines when its supposed to.
maybe ill go back and fix it one day, maybe not.
